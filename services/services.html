        <h2>How Do Solar Panels Work?</h2><br><br>
        <p>
            Solar panels are fast becoming one of the world’s most popular energy solutions. Why? Because it’s
            renewable. In short,
            if the sun exists, so does solar power. Unlike other sources of energy, such as gas and coal, which aren’t
            infinite,
            we’ll never run out of solar power.
        </p><br><br><br>

        <p>
            Without getting too technical, we believe that consumers should understand the basics of solar energy. So,
            we’ll break
            it down for you.
        </p><br><br><br>

        <p>
            Simply put, solar panels capture the sun’s UV rays and convert them into electricity to power your home
            using
            photovoltaic cells. When sunlight hits the cells, they become energised, creating a direct current. Every
            solar system
            then needs an inverter that converts the energy generated from direct current into alternating current to
            power
            household items.
