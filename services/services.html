        <h2>How Do Solar Panels Work?</h2><br>
        <p>
            Solar panels are fast becoming one of the world’s most popular energy solutions. Why? Because it’s
            renewable. In short,
            if the sun exists, so does solar power. Unlike other sources of energy, such as gas and coal, which aren’t
            infinite,
            we’ll never run out of solar power.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Without getting too technical, we believe that consumers should understand the basics of solar energy. So,
            we’ll break
            it down for you.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Simply put, solar panels capture the sun’s UV rays and convert them into electricity to power your home
            using
            photovoltaic cells. When sunlight hits the cells, they become energised, creating a direct current. Every
            solar system
            then needs an inverter that converts the energy generated from direct current into alternating current to
            power
            household items.

            <h2>It's Renewable Energy</h2><br>
            <p>Unlike other energy sources, solar power is renewable. Solar power is available every day globally and
                will
                only ever
                run out if the sun suddenly ceases to exist. If there is daylight, we can generate power thanks to solar
                technology.</p>

            <h2>You're helping the planet</h2><br>
            <p>On top of the energy crisis, we’re also battling an increasingly concerning climate crisis. Investing in
                solar panels
                means you’ll sleep better a night knowing you’re doing your bit for the planet. With the exception of
                the minimal
                pollution produced during manufacturing, solar power is one of the cleanest and most sustainable energy
                sources in the
                world. The best bit? As technology advances, solar panels are becoming more efficient every year!</p>

            <h2>You can store the energy</h2><br>
            <p>When you invest in a battery storage system for your solar set-up, you can bank energy to use around the
                clock. So,
                while solar panels require daylight to generate energy, that doesn’t mean you’ll be without power when
                the sun sets.</p>

            <h2>You can make money</h2><br>
            <p>Speaking of energy storage, you can actually earn money from any excess you don’t use. Yes, you read that
                right. Thanks
                to the Government’s Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), households can make money by exporting renewable
                electricity they
                haven’t used.

                If your system meets eligibility requirements and you have a smart meter that can provide half-hourly
                export readings,
                you’ll qualify for the tariff. According to the Energy Saving Trust, a ‘typical household’ can earn
                around £100 a year
                and switch between SEG tariffs until you get the best return.</p>
